# Repository

A basic abstraction for a repository/data-storage.

Essentially `get`,`set`&`delete` in one Interface that could use be any data-source.

Includes implementations for array-based & file-based (with & w/o caching) storage.

(mostly intended to be used alongside `rikta/query`)

## Installation 

`composer require rikta/repository`

## Usage

Take a look into [./tests/AbstractRepositoryTestCase.php](tests/AbstractRepositoryTestCase.php) until I have refined
the Readme ;)
